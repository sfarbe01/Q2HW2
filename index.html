    <h2>Problems Solved by Responsive Web Design</h2>
      <p>As a marketing professional, I have come to appreciate the important of Responsive Web Design (RWD). RWD is crucial for providing the best possible web experience for users. Whether they've come to your site to learn more about your company, or they want to buy something from your site, it's imperative to present content in a way that is easily navigable. As mobile devices (tablets and mobile phones) become more and more popular, it is important to design web pages to respond to these different screen sizes without compromising on the content of the page. RWD is a departure from optimizing a website for a specific screen size. Instead of simply adding “/mobile” to the end of a site and creating an entirely new experience, the architecture is flexible and responds not only to the size of the screen, but to the needs of its user. RWD ensures that content will not only look great on a screen of any size, but function well.
